# FiveM Jet Radar

## About
This is a STANDLONE Jet Radar project with a lot of customization options. 

## Usage
There is nothing much to say. Look through the configs, read the documentation but basically it's the following. 
Get in a supported vehicle, fly above the "EnableAbove" config options and boom!

## How it works
So I used an interesting approach here, the LUA client sends the nearby vehicles regulalry but the NUI ONLY updates when the "scanner" made 1 turn, and is back at the very top.
Check the FiveM forum page, and the video, you'll understand it!

## Features
### Friendly vehicle system
**At the moment all "friendly vehicles" mean is that their icon on the radar will have a different color.**
- It provides 4 client events:
- **jet_radar:registerVehicleAsFriendly**    < ARGUMENT: vehicle | register it as friendly
- **jet_radar:removeVehicleAsFriendly**      < ARGUMENT: vehicle | remove from friendlies
- **jet_radar:clearFriendlyVehicles**        < NO ARGUMENTS      | clears the "friendlyVehicles" array back to empty
- **jet_radar:getFriendlyVehicles**          < NO ARGUMENTS      | returns the registered friendly vehicles


***Please note that these events are client-side! So for example if you trigger "jet_radar:getFriendlyVehicles" from a server-script it WON'T return anything.***

### The resource contains 2 configs. One for the visual options (config.js, the top screenshot) and one for the "logical" options (config.lua, the bottom screenshot)
